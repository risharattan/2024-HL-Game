**** Instructions ****

To begin, choose th number of rounds and either customise
the game parameters or go with the default game (where the
secret number will be between 1 and 100).

Then choose how many rounds you'd like to play <enter> for
infinite mode.

Your goal is to try to guess the secret number without
running out of guesses. 

Good luck.
